Lastbox
=======

Last.fm submission script for Rockbox' scrobbler.log. Nothin special.

Doesn't require any additional libraries except Python 2.7 installation.

Usage
-----

1. Connect (and mount) your player to the computer.
2. Run the script.
3. If it is run in the first time, it'll ask you for username and password (password isn't kept anywhere, don't afraid).
4. If there are artist you've never listened before, Lastbox will ask you, do you really want to submit thacks of them (I hope, one day Rockbox scrobbler will support 'Album artist` tags).
5. That's all.
